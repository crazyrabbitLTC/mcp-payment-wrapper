# Enhanced Test Plan for MCP Payment Wrapper

This document outlines an enhanced testing strategy to ensure the payment wrapper's proxy functionality is working 100% correctly in all scenarios.

## Current Testing Status

Our current tests in `payment-wrapper.comprehensive.test.ts` provide good coverage of basic functionality:
- Tool, resource, and prompt method interception
- Billing checks and charge processing
- Error handling for common scenarios

However, to ensure 100% reliability of the proxy implementation, we need to expand our testing to cover more edge cases and complex scenarios.

## Enhanced Testing Strategy

### 1. Proxy Behavior Tests

#### Method Forwarding
- Test that all methods on the original server are properly forwarded through the proxy
- Verify that method context (`this`) is preserved correctly
- Test method chaining (if applicable)
- Test with various argument types (primitives, objects, functions, etc.)

#### Property Access
- Test access to properties on the original server
- Test property descriptors (getters, setters, etc.)
- Verify that property changes on the proxy affect the original server

#### Prototype Chain
- Test that the proxy maintains the correct prototype chain
- Verify that `instanceof` checks work correctly
- Test inheritance relationships

### 2. Edge Case Tests

#### Concurrency
- Test multiple simultaneous calls to the same method
- Test interleaved calls to different methods
- Test race conditions in billing checks

#### Error Propagation
- Test that errors from the original server are properly propagated
- Test error handling during billing checks
- Test error recovery and subsequent calls

#### Memory Management
- Test for memory leaks in long-running scenarios
- Verify that the proxy doesn't retain references unnecessarily

### 3. Integration Tests

#### Transport Integration
- Test with different transport mechanisms (HTTP, WebSocket, etc.)
- Verify that the proxy works correctly with transport-specific features

#### Client Integration
- Test with actual MCP clients
- Verify end-to-end functionality

### 4. Performance Tests

#### Overhead Measurement
- Measure the performance overhead of the proxy
- Compare direct calls vs. proxied calls
- Identify performance bottlenecks

#### Scaling Tests
- Test with large numbers of tools, resources, and prompts
- Test with high call volumes

### 5. Security Tests

#### Authentication
- Test various JWT token formats and claims
- Test token expiration handling
- Test with malformed tokens

#### Authorization
- Test access control based on user roles
- Test resource-specific permissions

#### Input Validation
- Test with malicious or unexpected inputs
- Verify that input validation is properly applied

## Implementation Plan

We'll implement these tests in phases:

### Phase 1: Proxy Behavior Tests
- Create a new test file `payment-wrapper.proxy.test.ts`
- Implement tests for method forwarding, property access, and prototype chain
- Focus on verifying that the proxy correctly represents the original server

### Phase 2: Edge Case Tests
- Create a new test file `payment-wrapper.edge-cases.test.ts`
- Implement tests for concurrency, error propagation, and memory management
- Use tools like Jest's fake timers for time-dependent tests

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
- Create a new test file `payment-wrapper.integration.test.ts`
- Set up test environments with different transports
- Create mock clients for end-to-end testing

### Phase 4: Performance and Security Tests
- Create test files for performance and security testing
- Implement benchmarking for performance tests
- Create security test scenarios

## Test Utilities

To support these tests, we'll create the following utilities:

### Proxy Inspection Utilities
- Functions to inspect proxy behavior
- Tools to track method calls and property access

### Mock Server Factory
- Function to create mock MCP servers with configurable behavior
- Support for simulating various server states and behaviors

### Test Helpers
- Utilities for common test patterns
- Assertion helpers for proxy-specific checks

## Success Criteria

The enhanced test suite will be considered successful when:

1. All tests pass consistently
2. We have at least 95% code coverage
3. We've verified all edge cases identified in this plan
4. We've documented any limitations or known issues

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 tests (Proxy Behavior)
2. Review and refine the test approach
3. Implement Phase 2 tests (Edge Cases)
4. Continue with subsequent phases
5. Document test results and findings
